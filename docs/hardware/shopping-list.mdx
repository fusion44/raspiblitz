The cheapest way is to buy and assemble the single parts yourself.
There are two packages.

_Please try to use the exact hardware models that are recommended in the shopping lists.
We have had multiple reports where, for example, other SSD or SSD cases/controllers lead to problems.
The idea of the shopping lists is to provide you the best tested hardware components that work together - improvement recommendations are always welcome._

- LCD - 3.5" RPi Display, GPIO connection, XPT2046 Touch Controller: [amazon referral link](https://geni.us/raspiblitz-touchscreen)

_If the above mentioned LCD screen is sold out you can also use these different vendors for the screen on Amazon:_

- Quimat 3,5'' Zoll Inch Touch
- ELEGOO Display 3.5" Zoll TFT LCD
- kuman 3.5 Inch Touch Screen TFT Monitor
- Waveshare 3.5inch Display for Raspberry Pi

With all LCD screen models dont use the ones that have an HDMI port/connector - what you need is a 3.5 inch LCD screen model (resolution of 480Ã—320) that connects only thru the GPIO ports (SPI) and has an XPT2046 touch controller.
