## SECURITY DISCLAIMER

This is Open-Source Software licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). This license explicitly excludes the authors & publishers from any legal liabilities including funds you manage with this software. Its use at your own risk - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) legal text for details.

Also the RaspiBlitz offers lots of additional apps for install. With every additional app installed (or preinstalled in a fatpack sd card image) you are trusting also the authors & dependencies of those additional projects with the security of your system & funds (different legal licensed may apply also). To reduce preinstalled apps & features from the start we provide a minimal sd card image for more advanced users (see download section below). For more details on this topic see our [SECURITY](SECURITY.md) documentation.
