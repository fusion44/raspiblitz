# SSH Menu

Once the Blockchain is synced you will enter the SSH Main Menu:

All options on the main menu will be explained below in the feature documentation.

_OK ..
so from here on out, your RaspiBlitz is ready to play with._

If you need an idea of what the most basic next steps to experience Lightning would be:

- Fund on-chain wallet
- Open a channel
- Make a payment

If you would prefer to do this from a web browser with a dashboard UI, instead of an SSH terminal, go to `SERVICES`, activate the `RTL Webinterface`, and after install you will find a new menu option for RTL in the SSH main menu - it will give you all the information so that you can now open the RTL web interface in your browser.
