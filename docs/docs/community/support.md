# Support

If you run into a problem or you have still a question, follow the steps below to get support.
Also check the [setup documentation](#setup-process-detailed-documentation) for details.

### Documentation

1. Look up the [FAQ](../faq/faq.md) if you can't find an answer to this question/problem.

2. If you have a hardware problem, please check that your hardware parts are exactly the parts recommended in the shopping list above. Different screens or even SSD-casings can cause problems.

3. Please determine if your problem/question is about RaspiBlitz or for example with LND or Core Lightning. For example if you can't route a payment or get an error when opening a channel that is an LND/Core Lightning question/problem and is best answered by the [LND dev community](https://dev.lightning.community) or the [Core Lightning documentation](https://lightning.readthedocs.io/)

4. Go to the GitHub issues of the RaspiBlitz: [https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues) Do a search there. Also check closed issues by removing 'is:open' from the filter/search-box.

5. If you haven't found an answer yet, open a new issue on the RaspiBlitz GitHub. You may have to register an account with GitHub for this. If it's a bug with the RaspiBlitz, please add (copy+paste) a Debug Report to your issue (see [FAQ](../faq/faq.md) for how to generate them) and/or add some screenshots/photos so the community gets more insight into your problem.
