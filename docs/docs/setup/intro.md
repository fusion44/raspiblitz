:::caution
Also the RaspiBlitz offers lots of additional apps for install. With every additional app installed (or preinstalled in a fatpack sd card image) you are trusting also the authors & dependencies of those additional projects with the security of your system & funds (different legal licensed may apply also). To reduce preinstalled apps & features from the start we provide a minimal sd card image for more advanced users (see download section below). For more details on this topic see our [SECURITY](/docs/security) documentation.

## Time Estimate to Set Up a RaspiBlitz

The RaspiBlitz is optimized for being setup during a workshop at a hackday or conference (see [detailed workshop tutorial](../community/workshops.md)).
When it comes fully assembled with an up-to-date synced blockchain, it's possible to have it ready in about 2 to 3 hours.

If you start at home ordering the parts from Amazon (see shopping list below) then it's a weekend project with a lot of downloading and syncing time where you can do other stuff while checking on the progress from time to time.

If you already run a Umbrel, Citadel or myNode you have basically all the hardware needed and you can make the [Migration to RaspiBlitz from Umbrel/Citadel/myNode](#make-a-raspiblitz-out-of-your-umbrel-citadel-or-mynode) under one hour.
