You can choose from two ready-made sd card images below:

### FATPACK SD Card Image (Beginners - WebUI)

This is the sd card image you should choose if your at the beginning of your RaspiBlitz journey or you are a casual node runner wanna download the next update/upgrade - with WebUI & fast installing bonus apps.

### MINIMAL SD Card Image (Experienced Users - SSH)

This is the sd card image for RaspiBlitz users that are already more experienced and want to use just a limited set of features of the RaspiBlitz. This image has just the bare minimum of features pre-installed - LCD & HDMI output is off by default. Setup, Update or Recovery needs to be done thru SSH login - API & WebUI are later available but are not preinstalled/activated by default. The RaspiBlitz will download & compile just the tools that are in your ´raspiblitz.conf´ - this will take longer but as a trade-off this RaspiBlitz then just runs with a reduced set of dependencies and so a minimalized attack vector and better performance. Its for the serious & experienced node runners.

## Write the SD-Card image to your SD Card

You need to write the downloaded SD card image (the img.gz-file) to your SD card (32GB minimum) - you can use the very easy tool Balena Etcher for this: <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>.
It's available for Win, Mac & Linux.
